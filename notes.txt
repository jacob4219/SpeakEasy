This sounds like a great feature set for your app. In order to replicate this functionality in your React app, you can create a component that manages the state for the recently entered text, and another component for the favorites. You can also create a container component that renders the input field, the recent text containers, and the favorite text containers.

When the enter button is pressed, you can use the setState hook to add the entered text to an array that is stored in the state. You can then use the map function to render the recently entered text containers, each with a play button, a delete button, and a favorite button. The play button can use the speak method of the SpeechSynthesisUtterance object to play the text using the currently selected voice. The delete button can use the setState hook to remove the text from the state array, and the favorite button can use the setState hook to move the text to a separate array for favorites.

For the favorites list, you can create another component that manages the state for the favorite text, and renders the favorite text containers, with a similar set of buttons, such as play, delete, and lock. The lock button can be used to prevent the user from editing or deleting the container.

By breaking down the app into smaller components and managing the state for each component, you can achieve a similar functionality to the vanilla JS app, and make it more maintainable and reusable in the future.


experimental code:

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useSpeechSynthesis } from 'react-speech-kit';
import SpeechRecognition, { useSpeechRecognition } from 'react-speech-recognition';

##################################################################### Speech To Text 

Sure, here is how you can integrate the two components:

In the TextToSpeech component, add a prop text and a function prop setText that will update the state of the text in the component. Also, remove the const [text, setText] = useState(''); line since it will be passed as a prop.
Copy code
function TextToSpeech({ text, setText }) {
In the TextToSpeech component, update the handleEnter function to call the setText function prop instead of updating the state.
Copy code
const handleEnter = (e) => {
    if(e.key === 'Enter') {
      speak({ text: text, voice: voice, ...audioSettings });
      setText('');
    }
  }
In the SpeechToText component, pass the finalTranscript and setFinalTranscript as props to the TextToSpeech component.
Copy code
<TextToSpeech text={finalTranscript[0]} setText={setFinalTranscript} voice={voice} audioSettings={audioSettings}/>
In the SpeechToText component, remove the state for audioSettings and voice and remove the props for them in the TextToSpeech component. Since AudioAdjusters component is using the same state.

In the SpeechToText component, remove the TextToSpeech import and add the AudioAdjusters import.

Copy code
import AudioAdjusters from './audio-adjusters';
Inside the SpeechToText component, add the AudioAdjusters component and pass the setFinalTranscript and finalTranscript as props to it.
Copy code
<AudioAdjusters finalTranscript={finalTranscript} setFinalTranscript={setFinalTranscript} />
In the AudioAdjusters component, update the component to use the passed finalTranscript and setFinalTranscript props.
Copy code
const AudioAdjusters = ({ finalTranscript, setFinalTranscript }) => {
In the AudioAdjusters component, update the handleMute function to call the speak function with the finalTranscript and mute state.
Copy code
const handleMute = () => {
    setMute(!mute);
    speak({ text: finalTranscript, mute });
  };
This should allow the SpeechToText component to pass the recognized speech to the TextToSpeech component and update the state when the Dictate button is pressed. Also, the AudioAdjusters component should be able to control the audio settings and mute the speech.

############################### Back End ########################################

Great, proceeding with Node.js is a good choice as it is a popular and widely-used technology for building backends.

Here are the steps you can take to set up a backend for your React project:

Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer if you haven't already.

Create a new folder in your project directory to hold the backend files, and navigate to it in your command line.

Initialize a new Node.js project by running npm init -y. This will create a package.json file in your backend folder.

Install the necessary packages for your backend. For example, you can install Express for routing, MongoDB for a database, and Passport for user authentication. You can install these packages by running npm install express mongodb passport.

Set up the server. In a new file named server.js or index.js, import the necessary packages and configure your server. For example, you can use Express to set up routing, and MongoDB to connect to your database.

Set up user authentication. You can use Passport for this, and there are many strategies available such as Local strategy, JWT strategy, OAuth strategy and many more.

Test your backend by starting the server with node server.js or nodemon server.js and make a request to it using a tool like Postman.

Once your backend is set up and working properly, you can integrate it with your React frontend by making API calls from your frontend code to your backend.

Please let me know if you need any further help on any specific step.



Setting up a Node.js server:
First, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website (https://nodejs.org/en/)

Next, create a new directory for your backend server. In this directory, initialize a new Node.js project by running npm init in the command line. This will create a package.json file, which will contain information about your project and its dependencies.

In the same directory, you will also want to create a new file called server.js. This file will contain the code for your server.

To set up the basic structure of the server, you will need to import the http module from the Node.js core library. This module allows you to create a server that can handle HTTP requests and responses.

Create a new instance of the http.Server class and set up a listener for the request event. This event will be emitted every time a client makes a request to your server.

In the callback function for the request event, you can access information about the request, such as the URL, headers, and body. You can also use this function to send a response to the client by calling the response.end() method.

Start the server by calling the listen() method on the http.Server instance, and passing in a port number as an argument.

Now that the server is running, you can test it by sending a request to http://localhost:<port> in your browser or using a tool like curl or postman.

The above steps should get you a basic server running, and it's a good starting point for creating a more complex server with routing, handling different HTTP methods, handling different routes, connecting to a database and so on.
