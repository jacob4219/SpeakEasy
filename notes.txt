This sounds like a great feature set for your app. In order to replicate this functionality in your React app, you can create a component that manages the state for the recently entered text, and another component for the favorites. You can also create a container component that renders the input field, the recent text containers, and the favorite text containers.

When the enter button is pressed, you can use the setState hook to add the entered text to an array that is stored in the state. You can then use the map function to render the recently entered text containers, each with a play button, a delete button, and a favorite button. The play button can use the speak method of the SpeechSynthesisUtterance object to play the text using the currently selected voice. The delete button can use the setState hook to remove the text from the state array, and the favorite button can use the setState hook to move the text to a separate array for favorites.

For the favorites list, you can create another component that manages the state for the favorite text, and renders the favorite text containers, with a similar set of buttons, such as play, delete, and lock. The lock button can be used to prevent the user from editing or deleting the container.

By breaking down the app into smaller components and managing the state for each component, you can achieve a similar functionality to the vanilla JS app, and make it more maintainable and reusable in the future.
